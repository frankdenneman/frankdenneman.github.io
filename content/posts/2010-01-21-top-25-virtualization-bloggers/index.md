This week Eric Siebert processed all the votes and published this year’s Top 25 VMware/Virtualization Blogger list. Over 700 people voted, each casting 10 votes. I can only imagine the work involved that is put in to producing this list, so a big thank you goes out to Eric for voluntary organizing this! Awesome! This year a lot of new names entered the top 25 including my blog. I never ever expected to see my name published in the top 25. I’m truly honored to make it to the list, let alone be voted number #14 so I would like to thank everyone for voting for me! I really appreciate it! Congratulations to all other people mentioned in the list and I would like to congratulate Duncan Epping specifically for taking the number 1 place again this year.

A new home Being voted one of the top 25 bloggers, puts a lot of pressure on one. I hope to continue blogging articles people find interesting. And to make a good start, [frankdenneman.wordpress.com](http://frankdenneman.wordpress.com) moved to [www.frankdenneman.nl](http://www.frankdenneman.nl).
