[Eric Siebert](http://twitter.com/ericsiebert) of [vSphere-land](http://vsphere-land.com/), together with [David Davis](http://twitter.com/davidmdavis), [Simon Seagrave](http://twitter.com/Kiwi_Si) and [John Troyer](http://twitter.com/jtroyer) announced the results of the Top 25 blogs election this week. Using vChat is in my opinion a very cool format and I had the feeling that I was watching the academy awards for Bloggers. Gentlemen, thank you for taking the time and effort to create this entertaining show. Next time I will be viewing this from my TV instead of my 13" laptop screen and making sure I'll have the popcorn ready. But most of all I want to thank everyone who voted for me. According to you my blog belongs in the top 10 and I’m very proud and honored to be ranked up that high. Thank you very much!
