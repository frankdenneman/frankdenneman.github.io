Later on this month, I will be attending the Deutsche VMUG and the London VMUG. As part of the events, I have the opportunity to deliver the keynote on the upcoming service VMware Cloud on AWS. Many of you will already be aware that [Niels](https://twitter.com/NHagoort) and I are releasing the [VMware vSphere 6.5 Host Resource Deep Dive](https://twitter.com/HostDeepDive). Together we will provide a session at both events zooming into ESXi hosts designs, highlighting some interesting behavior from a component and VMkernel perspective.
