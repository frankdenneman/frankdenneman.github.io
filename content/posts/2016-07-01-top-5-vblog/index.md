Yesterday the [top 25 vBlogs](http://vsphere-land.com/news/announcing-the-top-vblog-2016-results.html) were announced and once again I'm in the top 5. I would like to thank all who have voted for me! It's great to see that the content is appreciated. The broadcast: https://youtu.be/-Kb6gAys0jc Looking forward, there is a lot of content getting ready to be published and I hope to release my 5th book this year, the vSphere 6.x host resource deep dive. I'm excited about the content I'm working on and I'll hope you guys will too! Thanks! Frank
