Yesterday [Duncan](http://twitter.com/duncanyb "Duncan on twitter") and I where discussing the 5.5 update of the vSphere clustering deepdive book and we were debating which HA admission control policy is the most popular. Last week I asked around on twitter, but hopefully a short poll will give us better insights. Please cast your vote. \[socialpoll id="2195435"\]
