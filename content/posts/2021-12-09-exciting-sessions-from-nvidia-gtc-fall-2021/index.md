Over the last few weeks, I watched many sessions of the NVIDIA Fall version of GTC. I created a list of interesting sessions for a group of people internally at VMware, but I thought the list might interest some outside VMware. It's primarily focused on understanding NVIDIA's product and services suite and not necessarily deep diving into technology or geeking out on core counts and speeds and feeds. If you found exciting sessions that I haven't listed, please leave them in the comments below.
