Next week we are back in Las Vegas. Busy times ahead with meeting customers, old friends, making new friends, and presenting a few sessions. Next week I will present at Customer Technical Exchange (CTEX), {code}, and host two meet-the-expert sessions. I will also participate as a part-time judge at the {code} hackathon.
