I noticed that our [technical deep dive session on VMware Cloud on AWS](https://my.vmworld.com/scripts/catalog/uscatalog.jsp?search=LHC2384BU&showEnrolled=false) was added to the content catalog of VMworld. In this session, Ray Budavari and I will cover the VMware Cloud on AWS infrastructure in detail. For the first time, we are allowed to uncover details about the host configuration, the vSAN infrastructure and of course network topology. We explore advanced features such as Elastic DRS and Autoremediation HA. The last 15 minutes of our session allows you to ask questions about VMC. Please [register](https://my.vmworld.com/scripts/catalog/uscatalog.jsp?search=LHC2384BU&showEnrolled=false) if you don't want to miss this session. Both Ray and I have a full schedule, therefore we are unable to schedule a repeat of this session during VMworld US.
