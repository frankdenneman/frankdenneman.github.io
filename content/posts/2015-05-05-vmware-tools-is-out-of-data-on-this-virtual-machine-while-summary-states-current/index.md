For some apparent reason all my virtual machines show an alert that the VMware tools is out of date. While the summary states that its running the current version [![VMware Tools is out of data on this virtual machine while summary states Current](images/VMware-Tools-is-out-of-data-on-this-virtual-machine-while-summary-states-Current-680x203.png)](http://frankdenneman.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/VMware-Tools-is-out-of-data-on-this-virtual-machine-while-summary-states-Current.png) When trying to upgrade the VMware tools, all options are grayed out: [![Grayed out VMtools options](images/Grayed-out-VMtools-options-450x396.png)](http://frankdenneman.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Grayed-out-VMtools-options.png) It appears to be a cosmetic error but I stil wanted to know why it shows the alert on my virtual machines. As it turns out I created my templates on my management cluster host (lab) and that host runs a newer version of vSphere 5.5 (2068190) [![Management cluster version](images/Management-cluster-version-680x275.png)](http://frankdenneman.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Management-cluster-version.png) My workload cluster host run a slightly older version of vSphere 5.5 and it uses a different version of VMtools. [![Workload cluster version](images/Workload-cluster-version-680x284.png)](http://frankdenneman.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Workload-cluster-version.png) The VMtools version list helps you to identify which version of VMtools installed in your virtual machine belongs to which ESXi version: [https://packages.vmware.com/tools/versions](https://packages.vmware.com/tools/versions "https://packages.vmware.com/tools/versions") Hope this clarifies this weird behavior of the UI for some.
