Lately the amount of content of frankdenneman.nl is getting a bit stale, so a small update from my side to show what I’ve been up to and that this blog is still alive. **vSphere x Clustering Deepdive** ![](images/vsphere-5-tease2.png "vsphere 5 tease")Duncan and I are working (feverishly) on a new book for a while. Calling it an update of the 4.1 HA and DRS technical deepdive won’t do the book any justice as the old chapters are complete rewritten. The HA section will cover the new HA stack of the upcoming vSphere version, while the focus of the DRS section leans more towards resource management. In addition this book covers Storage DRS and introduces a cool new feature called “supporting deep dives” These additional deep dives expand on supporting technologies of the main cluster feature set, it will contain in-depth information of technologies such as vMotion, Storage vMotion, EVC and certain new technologies introduced in the upcoming version of vSphere. I bet you guys will love this stuff. **Speaking at VMworld 2011** Last Friday I received very good news. In my previous post I asked everyone to consider voting on the sessions I participate in and the good news is that both sessions were accepted. Session VSP1682 - vSphere 5 clustering Q&A, co-presenting with Duncan is accepted for both VMworld Las Vegas as well as VMworld Europe in Copenhagen. The second session, VSP1425 - Ask the Experts vBloggers, I'm proud to join the incredible line-up of Chad Sackac, Duncan Epping, Rick Scherer and Scott Lowe to help answer questions on virtualization design. After 5 years of visit VMworld as an attendee, I finally get to experience what it’s like to be at the other side of the room.
