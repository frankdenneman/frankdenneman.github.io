Today the technical paper “[VMware vCloud Director Resource Allocation Models](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/10325)” has been made available for download on VMware.com. This whitepaper covers the allocation models used by vCloud Director 1.5 and how they interact with the vSphere layer. This paper helps you correlate the vCloud allocation model settings with the vSphere resource allocation settings. For example what happens on the vSphere layer when I set a guarantee on an Org VDC configured with the Allocation Pool Model. It provides insight on the distribution of resources on both the vCloud layer and vSphere layer and illustrates the impact of various allocation model settings on vSphere admission control. The paper contains a full chapter about allocation model in practice and demonstrates the effect of using various combinations of allocation models within a single provider vDC. Please note that this paper is based on vCloud Director 1.5 [http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/10325](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/10325)
