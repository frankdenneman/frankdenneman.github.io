We are looking into the combination of licensed workload and hard-affinity rules ([Must run on rule](http://frankdenneman.nl/2010/12/01/vm-host-affinity-rules-should-or-must/)). If you deploy this in your environment right now, how do you deal with this during maintenance hours? Your input helps in shaping future features.
