The entire week Amazon hasn’t been able to index both vSphere 5 Clustering technical deepdive editions properly. We are working with Createspace to fix these problems. In the meantime, both full color and black and white editions can be ordered at Createspace: Black and White: [https://www.createspace.com/3641804](https://www.createspace.com/3641804) $29.95 Full Color: [https://www.createspace.com/3586911](https://www.createspace.com/3586911) $49.95 An update follows as soon as Amazon list the paperbacks.
