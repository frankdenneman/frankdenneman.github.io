After spending almost a year on writing, drawing and editing, the moment Duncan and I waited for finally arrived… Our new book, the **vSphere 4.1 HA and DRS technical deepdive** is available on [CreateSpace](https://www.createspace.com/3494065) and [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1456301446?ie=UTF8&tag=frankdenneman-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1456301446). Early this year Duncan approached me and asked me if I was interested in writing a book together on HA and DRS, without hesitation I accepted the honor. Before discussing the contents of the book I would like take the opportunity to thank our technical reviewers for their time, their wisdom and their input: Anne Holler (VMware DRS Engineering), Craig Risinger (VMware PSO), [Marc Sevigny](http://twitter.com/#!/msevigny) (VMware HA Engineering) and [Bouke Groenescheij](http://twitter.com/#!/boukeg) ([Jume.nl](http://jume.nl/)). And a very special thanks to [Scott Herold](http://twitter.com/#!/vmguru) for writing the foreword! But most of all I would like to thank Duncan for giving me this opportunity to work together with him on creating this book. The in-depth discussions we had are without a doubt the most difficult I have ever experienced and were very interesting, both most of all fun! Thanks! Now let’s take a look at the book.Please note that we are still working on an electronic version of the book and we expect to finish this early 2011. This is the description of the book that is up on CreateSpace: **About the authors:** **Duncan Epping (VCDX 007)** is a Consulting Architect working for VMware as part of the Cloud Practice. Duncan works primarily with Service Providers and large Enterprise customers. He is focused on designing Public Cloud Infrastructures and specializes in bc-dr, vCloud Director and VMware HA. [Duncan](http://twitter.com/#!/DuncanYB) is the owner of [Yellow-Bricks.com](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/), the leading VMware blog. **Frank Denneman (VCDX 029)** is a Consulting Architect working for VMware as part of the Professional Services Organization. Frank works primarily with large Enterprise customers and Service Providers. He specializes in Resource Management, DRS and storage. Frank is the owner of frankdenneman.nl which has recently been voted number 6 worldwide on [vsphere-land.com](http://vsphere-land.com/) VMware vSphere 4.1 HA and DRS Technical Deepdive zooms in on two key components of every VMware based infrastructure and is by no means a “how to” guide. It covers the basic steps needed to create a VMware HA and DRS cluster, but even more important explains the concepts and mechanisms behind HA and DRS which will enable you to make well educated decisions. This book will take you in to the trenches of HA and DRS and will give you the tools to understand and implement e.g. HA admission control policies, DRS resource pools and host affinity rules. On top of that each section contains basic design principles that can be used for designing, implementing or improving VMware infrastructures. Coverage includes: • HA node types • HA isolation detection and response • HA admission control • VM Monitoring • HA and DRS integration • DRS imbalance algorithm • Resource Pools • Impact of reservations and limits • CPU Resource Scheduling • Memory Scheduler • DPM [![vSphere 4.1 HA and DRS Technical deepdive cover](images/coverlarge.jpg "vSphere_4.1_HA_and_DRS_Technical_deepdive_cover")](http://frankdenneman.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/coverlarge.jpg) We hope you will enjoy reading it as much as we did writing it. Thanks, Eric Sloof received a proof copy of the book and shot a [video](http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/1654-New-Book-VMware-vSphere-4.1-HA-and-DRS-Technical-Deepdive.html) about it.
