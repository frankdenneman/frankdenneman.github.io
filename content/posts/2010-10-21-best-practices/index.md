Last week at VMworld and the VCDX defense panels I heard the term “Best Practices” a lot. The term best practice makes me feel happy, shudder and laugh at the same time. Now when it comes to applying best practice I always use the analogy of crossing the road: [![](images/Look-right-50-web-150x150.jpg "Look-right-50-web")](http://frankdenneman.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Look-right-50-web.jpg) I am born and raised in the Netherlands and best practice is to look left first, then to the right and finally check left again before crossing the road. This best practice served me well and it helped me avoid being hit by a car/truck/crazy people on bikes and even trams and trolleys. But I ask you does this best practice still apply when I try to cross the street in London? Don’t get me wrong, best practice are useful and very valuable, but to apply a best practice blindly won’t be as lethal as my analogy but it can get you into a lot of trouble.
