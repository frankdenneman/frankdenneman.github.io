While searching for a diagram I stumbled upon an old diagram I made in 2007. I think this diagram started my whole obsession with diagrams and to add “cleanness” to my diagrams. [![](images/8468341762_df0e60f054_b_d.jpg "VI-Eco-System")](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8231/8468341762_df0e60f054_b_d.jpg) This diagram depicts a virtual infrastructure located in two datacenters with replication between them. This infrastructure is no longer in use, but to make absolutely sure, I changed the device names into generic text labels such as ESX host, array, SW switch, etc. Back then I really liked to draw Isometric style. Now I’m more focused onto block diagrams and trying to minimalize the number of components in a diagram. In essence I follow the words from Colin Chapman: Simplify, then add lightness. But then applied to diagrams :) The fact that this diagram is still stored on my system tells me that I’m still very proud of this diagram. So that made me wonder, which diagram did you design and are you proud of?
