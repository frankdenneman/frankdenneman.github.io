[![](images/DSC_1055-198x300.png "DSC_1055")](http://frankdenneman.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DSC_1055.png)As of today the paperback versions of the VMware vSphere 5 Clustering Technical Deepdive is available at Amazon. We took the feedback into account when creating this book and are offering a Full Color version and a Black and White edition. Initially we planned to release an Ebook and a Full Color version only, but due to the high production cost associated with Full color publishing, we decided to add a Black and White edition to the line-up as well. At this stage we do not have plans to produce any other formats. As this is self-publishing release we developed, edited and created everything from scratch. Writing and publishing a book based on new technology has serious impact on one’s life, reducing every social contact to a minimum even family life. As of this, our focus is not on releasing additional formats such as ibooks or Nook at this moment. Maybe at a later stage but VMworld is already knocking on our doors, so little time is left to spend some time with our families. When producing the book, the page count rapidly exceeded 400 pages using the 4.1 HA and DRS layout. As many readers told us they loved the compactness of the book therefor our goal was to keep the page count increase to a minimum. Adjusting the inner margins of the book was the way to increase the amount of space available for the content. A tip for all who want to start publishing, start with getting accustomed to publisher jargon early in the game, this will save you many failed proof prints! We believe we got the right balance between white-space and content in the book, reducing the amount of pages while still offering the best reading experience. Nevertheless the number of pages grew from 219 to 348. While writing the book, we received a lot of help and although Duncan listed all the people in his initial blog, I want to use take a moment to thank them again. First of all I want to thank my co-author Duncan for his hard work creating content, but also spending countless hours on communication with engineering and management. Anne Holler - DRS and SDRS engineer – Anne really went out of her way to help us understand the products. I frequently received long and elaborate replies regardless of time and day. Thanks Anne! Next up is Doug – its number Frank not amounts! – Baer. I think most of the time Doug’s comments equaled the amount of content inside the documents. Your commitment to improve the book impressed us very much. Gabriel Tarasuk-Levin for helping me understand the intricacies of vMotion. A special thanks goes out to our technical reviewers and editors: Keith Farkas and Elisha Ziskind (HA Engineering), Irfan Ahmad and Rajesekar Shanmugam (DRS and SDRS Engineering), Puneet Zaroo (VMkernel scheduling), Ali Mashtizadeh and Doug Fawley and Divya Ranganathan (EVC Engineering). Thanks for keeping us honest and contributing to this book. I want to thank VMware management team for supporting us on this project. Doug “VEEAM” Hazelman thanks for writing the foreword! **Availability** This weekend Amazon made both the black and white edition and the full color edition available.
