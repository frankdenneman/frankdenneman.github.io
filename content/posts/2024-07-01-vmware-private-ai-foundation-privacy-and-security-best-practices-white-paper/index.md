I'm excited to announce the release of my latest white paper, "[VMware Private AI Foundation - Privacy and Security Best Practices.](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/techpaper/vmware-private-ai-foundation-privacy-security.pdf)" As many of you know, the world of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, and with that comes a new set of challenges, particularly around privacy and security.

This white paper is not just about theory. It's a practical guide introducing the foundational concepts, frameworks, and models underpinning private AI security. It's a deep dive into the critical aspects of privacy and security in the context of AI, providing you with the tools to implement these principles in your own work. You'll learn about the principle of shared responsibility, threat modeling for Gen-AI applications, and the CIA triad – confidentiality, integrity, and availability – as a guiding model for information security.

And that's not all. In the near future, we'll be taking these concepts to the next level with a follow-up white paper focused on VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) settings. This paper will be your go-to resource for detailed guidance on configuring and optimizing VCF to establish a robust and secure private AI environment.

Stay tuned for this next installment, where we'll bridge the gap between theory and practice, empowering you to build and deploy private AI solutions confidently.

Thank you for your continued support, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!
