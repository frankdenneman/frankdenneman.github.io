In episode 047, we spoke with [Varghese Philipose](https://twitter.com/VPhilipose) about VMware's sustainability efforts and how they help our customers meet their sustainability goals. Features like the green score help many of our customers understand how they can lower their carbon emissions and hopefully reach net zero.
