[vSphere-land.com](http://http://vsphere-land.com/) is running it’s annual [Top 25 virtualization blog](http://vsphere-land.com/news/voting-now-open-for-the-top-vmware-virtualization-blogs.html) survey again and I’m really interested to see who are picked this year. Like previous year, some great bloggers disappear while other new great ones emerge. One guy I want to mention by name is [Chris Colotti](http://www.chriscolotti.us/), his blog is a great source of information about vCloud Director. If you haven’t visited his blog yet, go do that right away!. Last year I’ve been pretty busy writing, shaping, designing, wrestling with publishers in order to get our ([@DuncanYB](http://www.twitter.rs/DuncanYB)) book “vSphere 5 Clustering technical deepdive out to the public. This meant it cut down on research time, which resulted in a smaller number of blogs being released than previous years. So after seeing other people’s blog about their top 10, I was curious to see what I’ve done last year. The articles that are listed are the ones I’m proud of, spending a lot of time on researching them, but most of all, enjoyed the most writing them.
