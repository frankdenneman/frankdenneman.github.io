Last year [Rubrik](http://www.rubrik.com) gave away hard copies of the vSphere Host Deep Dive book, this year they are doing it again with the vSphere 6.7 Clustering Deep Dive Book.

Come by the Rubrik Booth #P305 on Tuesday from 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM to get a signed, complimentary copy of [vSphere 6.7 Clustering Deep Dive](http://frankdenneman.nl/2018/07/30/vsphere-6-x-deep-dive-resource-kit-completed/) and meet the authors.

Last year we gave away a thousand copies and were gone within an hour. As most of you can remember, the line was insane. This year we have a similar amount, so make sure you're on time.
