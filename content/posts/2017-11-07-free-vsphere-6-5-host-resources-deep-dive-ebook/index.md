In June of this year, [Niels](https://twitter.com/nhagoort/) and I published the [vSphere 6.5 Host Resources Deep Dive](http://frankdenneman.nl/2017/07/24/host-deep-dive-first-major-milestone/), and the community was buzzing. Twitter exploded, and many community members provided rave reviews. This excitement caught [Rubriks](https://www.rubrik.com/) attention, and they decided to support the community by giving away 2000 free copies of the printed version at VMworld. The interest was overwhelming, before the end of the second signing session in Barcelona we ran out of books. [![](images/front_cover_small.png)](http://pages.rubrik.com/host-resources-deep-dive_request.html?utm_campaign=Authors) A lot of people reached out to Rubrik and us to find out if they could get a free book as well. This gave us an idea, and we sat down with Rubrik and the [VMUG organization](https://www.vmug.com/) to determine how to cater the community. We are proud to announce that you can download the e-book version (PDF only) for free at rubrik.com. Just sign up and download your full e-book copy [here](http://pages.rubrik.com/host-resources-deep-dive_request.html?utm_campaign=Authors). Spread the word! And if you like, thank [@Rubrik](https://twitter.com/rubrikInc) and [@myVMUG](https://twitter.com/MyVMUG) for their efforts to help the VMware community advance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4spq5B4wtg
