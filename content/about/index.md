I am a Distinguished Engineer and Chief Technologist for AI in the AI and Advanced Services team at the VCF Division of Broadcom. My work focuses on solving resource-management challenges for AI workloads in the private datacenter, helping organizations design and operate AI platforms that are performant, scalable, and operationally sustainable.

In this role, I help shape the roadmap for the Private AI Foundation and influence the broader AI strategy across the VCF division. I regularly speak at global industry events, sharing practical insights on AI infrastructure architecture, GPU resource management, and the realities of running AI workloads outside of hyperscale public clouds.

I hold 14 patents in computer science, with contributions spanning compute resource management and AI infrastructure. Over the years, I have authored several widely regarded books on VMware vSphere clustering and host resource management, including:

I am a VMware Certified Design Expert (VCDX #29) and the author of the blog frankdenneman.nl, where I write about infrastructure architecture, scheduling behavior, and resource efficiency. For more than three years, I also hosted the *Unexplored Territory* podcast, engaging with the broader technology community on virtualization, infrastructure design, and the evolution toward AI-driven platforms.

Across writing, speaking, and engineering leadership, my focus remains consistent: enabling enterprises to run AI workloads effectively in their own datacenters by applying sound resource-management principles to modern, GPU-accelerated infrastructure.
