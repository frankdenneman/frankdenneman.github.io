Exactly one month ago Niels and I published the [VMware vSphere 6.5 Host Deep Div](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1540873064/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1540873064&linkCode=as2&tag=frankdennem0f-20&linkId=5afdf9e22610abeca733b5bd747d04d0)e and it is a major success. Within 30 days we sold over 4000 copies of the book. Building consistent high-performing ESXi hosts remains a strong focus point for the virtual community. The attention for the book is overwhelming. The hashtag #HostDeepDive felt like it was trending. Tweets from around the world letting us know the book arrived, from Brasil to New Zealand. https://twitter.com/DemitasseNZ/status/884599021980991488 The book seems to be a beloved companion during the summer holiday. [Christian Mohn](https://twitter.com/h0bbel) and [Erik Bussink](https://twitter.com/ErikBussink) engaged in a competition to provide us the best vacation shot possible. Mohn: https://twitter.com/h0bbel/status/886158966018977793 Bussink https://twitter.com/ErikBussink/status/886501115201818624 [Brad Tompkins](https://twitter.com/VMUG_CEO) of the VMUG organization joined the party by giving away twenty copies to the audience of the Indy VMUG last week. https://twitter.com/kmruddy/status/887293261714522112 Amazon awarded the book with many accolades, being the number one book in the network section and at one point it was in the top 25 of computer books overall. Quite an achievement! The absolute fantastic reviews help a lot. Thank you all for submitting a review! Due to the popularity of the book, Amazon offered us help with creating an ebook version of the book. They put their professional team to work two weeks ago, and we expect to have it online soon. Stay tuned!
