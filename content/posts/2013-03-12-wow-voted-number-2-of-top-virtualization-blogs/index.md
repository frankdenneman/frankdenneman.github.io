Voted number 2 of top virtualization blogs As many other IT-addicts, the first thing I do is pick up my phone to see what’s new on twitter, google+ and facebook and to my surprise I received a lot of direct messages and mentions congratulating on taking the second spot on the [top 25 virtualization blog list](http://vsphere-land.com/news/2013-top-vmware-virtualization-blog-voting-results.html "http://vsphere-land.com/news/2013-top-vmware-virtualization-blog-voting-results.html"). WOW talk about excitement! From being drowsy to uber-hyped in under a millisecond. Thanks for voting me! I really appreciate the recognition. I love to blog and write articles and when I’m not researching I’m thinking of topics I can cover. Reaching the number 2 spot proves I’m doing something you all like. But actually I want to thank you for taking the time to vote on any of the top 25 blogs. Everybody spends a great deal of time researching and writing articles, getting votes is a great way to receive acknowledgement for your hard work. A big thank you goes out to [Eric](https://twitter.com/ericsiebert "https://twitter.com/ericsiebert") for organizing this competition again. Awesome work and thanks for putting in all the effort. Viewing the stats it shows that this event is becoming more and more an industry event, organized by community members for community members. Great stuff.
