The last two years I enjoyed working as an architect within the PSO organization of VMware, designing and reviewing the most interesting virtual infrastructures in Europe. However today I signed my new contract, accepting a position within the Technical Marketing team. Starting December I will focus on resource management and disaster avoidance technologies. My new role allows me to collaborate with the Product managers and the R&D organization on products such as DRS, Storage DRS, vMotion, Storage vMotion and FT. My main tasks will be developing best practices, white-papers, documentation and technical presentations, educating field organizations and of course the customers. Although I enjoyed working within the PSO organization, I can’t wait to get started. Thanks to all the people who made my move possible and offering me such an opportunity!
