He was outed that he was using vSphere resource pool as folders. https://twitter.com/davidhill\_co/status/988797652346245126 A funny thread and he truly deserved all the public shaming by the community members ;). All fun aside, using resource pools as folders are not recommended by VMware. As I described in the new [vSphere 6.5 DRS white paper](https://vspherecentral.vmware.com/t/resource-management-and-availability/vsphere-resources-and-availability/vsphere-drs/) available at vSphere central: **Correct use:** Resource pools are an excellent construct to isolate a particular amount of resources for a group of virtual machines without having to micro-manage resource setting for each individual virtual machine. A reservation set at the resource pool level guarantees each virtual machine inside the resource pool access to these resources. Depending on the activity of these virtual machines these virtual machines can operate without any contention. **Incorrect use:** Resource pools should not be used as a form of folders within the inventory view of the cluster. Resource pools consume resources from the cluster and distribute these amongst its child objects within the resource pool; this can be additional resource pools and virtual machines. Due to the isolation of resources, using resource pools as folders in a heavily utilized vSphere cluster can lead to an unintended level of performance degradation for some virtual machines inside or outside the resource pool. Understanding this behavior allows you to design a correct resource pool structure. Currently, I'm working on a new vSphere DRS Resource Pool white paper which sheds some new light on the distribution of resources under normal conditions and under load (the Resource Pool Pie Paradox). I will keep you posted!
