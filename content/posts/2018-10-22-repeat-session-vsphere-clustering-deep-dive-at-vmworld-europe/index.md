Good news for the VMworld attendees who couldn't sign up anymore for the vSphere Clustering Deep Dive session on Tuesday. I'm happy to announce that the VMworld team scheduled a repeat session for the [vSphere Clustering Deep Dive session](https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld18eu/eucatalog?search=Denneman) on Thursday 08 November at 10:30 to 11:30. **Session Outline** In this session, [Duncan](https://twitter.com/DuncanYB) and Frank will take you through the trenches of VMware vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) and vSphere High Availability (HA). Find out about options to optimize your DRS settings for your specific requirements and goals, such as if you should be load balancing on active or consumed memory, as well as what has recently changed in the DRS algorithm and if it will impact DRS behavior. And for vSphere HA, you will learn about when it restarts virtual machines (VMs), what kind of restart times to expect, and where you can find evidence that a VM (or multiple) have been restarted. You will find out about all of these items and more. Prepare to dive deep, as the basics will not be covered. Don't wait too long with [registering](https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld18eu/eucatalog?search=Denneman), VMworld Europe room sizes max out at 400 people. We hope to see you there!
