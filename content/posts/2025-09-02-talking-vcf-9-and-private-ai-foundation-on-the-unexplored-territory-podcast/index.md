Just before VMware Explore, I joined the **Unexplored Territory Podcast** to talk about the enhancements in VMware Cloud Foundation 9 and the Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA. We covered new functionality, such as Agent Builder, and walked through the broader enhancements for AI workloads. We also highlighted a few must-attend sessions at Explore.

During Explore, many people told me this episode was a great starting point to wrap their heads around **VMware Private AI Foundation**. If you’re looking for a concise way to catch up, this is a good place to begin.

If you prefer shorter clips, here are a few highlights:

If you’ve had a chance to listen or watch, I’d love to hear what stood out most about the changes in VCF 9 or the Private AI Foundation.
