Today a new technical paper is available on [vmware.com](http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/10345 "VMware.com"). Description The CPU scheduler is an essential component of vSphere 5.x. All workloads running in a virtual machine must be scheduled for execution and the CPU scheduler handles this task with policies that maintain fairness, throughput, responsiveness, and scalability of CPU resources. This paper describes these policies, and this knowledge may be applied to performance troubleshooting or system tuning. This paper also includes the results of experiments on vSphere 5.1 that show the CPU scheduler maintains or exceeds its performance over previous versions of vSphere. If you are interested in CPU scheduling and in particular NUMA, download the paper: [The CPU Scheduler in VMware vSphere 5.1](http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/VMware-vSphere-CPU-Sched-Perf.pdf "The CPU Scheduler in VMware vSphere 5.1")
