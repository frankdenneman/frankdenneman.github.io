Unfortunately the [Open SSL Heartbleed bug](http://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2014-0004.html) (CVE-2014-0224) is present in the ESXi and vCenter 5.5 builds. VMware responded by incorporating a patch to solve the OpenSSL vulnerability in the OpenSSL 1.0.1 library. For more info about the ESXI 5.5 patch read KB [2076665](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2076665 "KB 2076665"), VMware issued two releases for vCenter 5.5, read KB [2076692](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2076692 "KB 2076692"). Unfortunately some NFS environments experienced connection loss after applying the [ESXi 5.5 patch](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2076392 "KB 2076392"), VMware responded by releasing patch [2077360](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2077360 "KB 2077360") and more recently [vCenter update 1b](https://www.vmware.com/support/vsphere5/doc/vsphere-vcenter-server-55u1b-release-notes.html "vCenter update 1b"). The coverage on the NFS problems and the amount of ESX and vCenter update releases to fix a bunch of problems may left organizations in the dark whether they patched the Heartbleed vulnerability. [Cloudphysics](http://www.Cloudphysics.com "Cloudphysics") released a free Heartbleed analytic card in their card store that helps identify which hosts in your environment are unprotected. Check out the [recent article](http://www.cloudphysics.com/blog/vmware-heartbleed/ "Heartbleed card") of Cloudphysics CTO, [Irfan Ahmad](https://twitter.com/virtualirfan "Irfan Ahmad on twitter") about their recently released Heartbleed analytic package. I would recommend to run the card and rid yourself of this nasty bug.
