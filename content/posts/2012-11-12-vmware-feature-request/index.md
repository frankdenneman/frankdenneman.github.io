During presentations I always stress to submit a feature request if you have an idea how to enhance the product or if you feel you are missing a vital product feature. VMware is very interested to hear how the products can be enhanced and improved. Although it’s always good to talk to your local VMware rep or your favorite VMware blogger, submitted feedback might not reach the correct person on time. In order to have the feedback routed to the correct person using the shortest path available, it is best to submit a feature request via the VMware website. Unfortunately VMware.com doesn’t have an action button on the front-page, therefor I thought it might be a good idea to publish a short article with the link included. If you have any feedback go to the [feature request page](https://www.vmware.com/contact/contactus.html?department=prod_request "VMware product feature request") and submit your comments. Thanks!
