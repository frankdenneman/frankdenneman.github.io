Simon Long of [The SLOG](http://www.simonlong.co.uk) is introducing vBeers to Holland. I've copied the text from his [vBeers blog article](http://www.simonlong.co.uk/blog/vbeers/).

> [![](images/vbeers.jpg "vbeers")](http://frankdenneman.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/vbeers.jpg)Every month Simon Seagrave and I try organise a social get together of like-minded Virtualization enthusiasts held in a pub in central London (and Amsterdam). We like to call it vBeers. Before I go on, I would just like to state, although it's called vBeers, you do NOT have to drink beer or any other alcohol for that matter. This isn't just an excuse to get blind drunk. We came up with idea whilst on the Gestalt IT Tech Field Day back in April. We were chatting and we both recognised that we don't get together enough to catch-up, mostly do to busy work schedules and private lives. We felt that if we had a set date each month, the likely hood of us actually making that date would be higher than previous attempts. So the idea of vBeers was born.

[![](images/herengracht-224x300.jpg "herengracht")](http://frankdenneman.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/herengracht.jpg)The second Amsterdam vBeers will be held on **Thursday 3rd of February** starting at 6:30pm in ‘Herengracht Cafe’ which is placed close to Leidseplein and Dam Square. This venue serves a fine of selection of beers along with soft drinks and bar food. Drinks will not be paid for, there will not be a tab. When you buy a drink please pay for it as no one else will be paying for your drinks. \* Location: The '[Herengracht Cafe](http://www.deherengracht.nl/)' Amsterdam \* Address: Herengracht 435, Herengracht/Leidsestraat \* Nearest Tram Station: Koningsplein – Lijn 1,2,5 \* Time: 6:30pm \* Location: [Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=herengracht+435&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=41.224889,93.515625&ie=UTF8&hq=herengracht+435&hnear=&radius=15000&ll=52.36711,4.888058&spn=0.003891,0.011415&z=17)
