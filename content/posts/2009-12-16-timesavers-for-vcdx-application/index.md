Last week VMware send out the invitations for the VCDX defend session at the Partner Exchange Las Vegas 2010. Like many others I’m trying to finish my application on time. So any help, shortcut and timesavers will help realize the goal. At this moment these tools and shortcuts save me lots of time: **Puretext** Steve miller created a simple but awesome tool. Puretext will strip any formatting while pasting text. This IS the lifesaver for me at the moment, because I’m copying text from older documents with different Fonttype and size. Run the small exe file and start loving the windows key + v command.
