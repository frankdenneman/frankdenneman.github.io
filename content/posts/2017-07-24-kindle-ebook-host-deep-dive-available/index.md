Funny enough I've just [published an article](http://frankdenneman.nl/2017/07/24/host-deep-dive-first-major-milestone/) announcing the major milestone of 4000 hard copies sold within the first month of release. I just received confirmation that the Kindle e-book version is available at the Amazon Kindle Store. It is scheduled to appear on various Amazon sites. Please check out your local Amazon for the best offer. [Amazon US](http://amzn.to/2urPNBj) [Amazon DE](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0746H6DFC) [Amazon NL](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B0746H6DFC) [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0746H6DFC) [Amazon India](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0746H6DFC) The most popular e-book version of the cluster deep dive was Kindle, and therefore we focused on getting the Kindle e-book out as fast as possible. The professionals of Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing created an awesome e-book version. Go check it out.
