One of the benefits of working for VMware technical marketing, is that you have your own lab. Luckily my lab is hosted by an external datacenter, which helps me avoid a costly power-bill at home each month :) However, that means I need to connect to my lab remotely. As a MAC user I used Remote Desktop Connection for MAC from Microsoft. One of the limiting factors of this RDP for MAC is the limited resolution of 1400 x 1050 px. The screens at home have a minimum resolution 2560 x 1440 px. This first world problem bugged me until today! Today I found CoRD - [http://cord.sourceforge.net/](http://cord.sourceforge.net/ "Cord at sourceforge"). CoRD allows me to connect to my servers with a resolution 2500 x 1600, using the full potential of my displays at home. [![Cord](images/Cord.png)](http://frankdenneman.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Cord.png) Another create option is the hotkey function, using a key combination I spin up a remote desktop connection. I love these kinds of shortcuts that help me reduce time spend navigating throughout the UI. If you are using a MAC and often RDP into your lab, I highly recommend to download CoRD. Btw, it's free ;)
