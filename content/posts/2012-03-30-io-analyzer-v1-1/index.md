I/O Analyzer v1.1 is now live on the Flings site: [http://labs.vmware.com/flings/io-analyzer](http://labs.vmware.com/flings/io-analyzer "http://labs.vmware.com/flings/io-analyzer") I/O Analyzer is a virtual appliance tool for measuring storage performance. This version of I/O Analyzer adds the ability to run trace replay – a function which allows a user to replay an I/O trace that was captured elsewhere (with vscsistats) on the target test system. This version also has cool data visualization charts, both for the characteristics of an imported trace, and performance results on the test system. This is really cool stuff, go check it out.
