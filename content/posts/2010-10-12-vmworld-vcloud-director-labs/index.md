Yesterday the VMworld Labs opened up to the public and if you want to take vCloud Director for a spin I’m recommending doing the following labs: **Private cloud – Management:** Lab 13 VMware vCloud Director Install and Config Lab 18 VMware vCloud Director Networking **Private Cloud - Security:** Lab20 VMware vShield Its best to complete Lab 18 vCloud Director Networking before doing VMware vShield Lab (Lab 20) because the terms and knowledge gained in Lab 18 will prepare you for Lab 20. Today the VMworld 2010 speaker sessions started and I strongly recommend Duncan’s session “[BC7803 - Planning and Designing an HA Cluster that Maximizes VM Uptime](http://www.vmworld.com/docs/DOC-4825)” and Kit Colbert’s “ [TA7750 - Understanding Virtualization Memory Management Concepts](http://www.vmworld.com/docs/DOC-4643)”. Go check it out.
