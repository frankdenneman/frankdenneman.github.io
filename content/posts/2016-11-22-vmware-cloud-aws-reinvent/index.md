Thank you for all the great feedback since we announced our partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) on October 13! We have seen a lot of interest for VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) from customers, partners, industry analysts, and social media. Following on from the announcement in San Francisco, we went on to Barcelona for VMworld Europe, and had multiple sold out sessions with our customers and partners in attendance. The #VMWonAWS hashtag on Twitter was pretty active as well, and we had our hands full answering all your questions! Next stop is AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas, unfortunately I won't be at re:Invent, but the core group of VMware on AWS cloud product team is. VMware is a Platinum Sponsor at re:Invent and the team to eager to talk about the service offering, use cases, architecture, Tech Preview demos and a lot more.
