If you are following us on twitter you may have seen some recent tweets regarding our forthcoming book. Duncan ([@duncanyb](http://www.twitter.com/duncanyb)) and I have already started work on a new version of the HA and DRS Technical Deepdive. The new book will cover HA and DRS topics for the upcoming vSphere release. We are also aiming to include information about SIOC and Storage DRS in this version. We received a lot of feedback about the vSphere 4.1 book, one of the main themes was the lack of color in the diagrams. We plan to use a more suitable grayscale color combination in the next version, but we wondered if our readers would be interested in a full color copy of the upcoming book. Obviously printing costs increase with full color printing and in addition, low volume cost of color printing can be quite high. We expect the price of the full color version to cost around $50 USD – $55 USD. \[poll id="1"\]
