Two weeks ago Pete Flecha (a.k.a. [Pedro Arrow](https://twitter.com/vPedroArrow)) and [John Nicholson](https://twitter.com/Lost_Signal) invited me to their always awesome podcast to talk about resource management. During our conversation, we covered both on-prem and the features of [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws) that help cater the needs of your workload.

Being a guest on this podcast is an honour and times flies talking to these two guys. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
