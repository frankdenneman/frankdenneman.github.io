VMware published an excellent document about VMFS volume management a few days ago. [VMware® VMFS Volume Management information guide](http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/vmfs_resig.pdf) The guide explains the VMFS volume header metadata mechanism and describes the new 3.5 setting SCSI.CompareLUNNumber. A must read if you use third-party storage snapshot and replication technology.
