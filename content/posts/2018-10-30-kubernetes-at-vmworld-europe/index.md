With only a few days left until [VMworld Europe 2018](https://www.vmworld.com/en/europe/index.html) kicks off in Barcelona, I would like to highlight some of the many Kubernetes focussed sessions. I've selected a bunch of breakout sessions and meet the expert sessions based on my exposure to them at VMworld US or the quality of the speaker. The content catalog has marked some sessions as "at capacity", but experience thought us that there are always a couple of no-shows. Plans change during VMworld. People register for a session they would like to attend but get pulled in an interesting conversation along the way. Or sometimes you suffer from information overload and want to catch a breather. In many cases, spots open at sold-out sessions and therefore it's always recommended to walk up to sold out sessions and try your luck.

## Tuesday 06 November

**11:00 - 12:00 \[NET1285BE\]** (Breakout Session) **[The Future of Networking and Security with VMware NSX](https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld18eu/eucatalog?search=NET1285BE)** This talk provides detailed insights into the architecture and capabilities of NSX-T. We'll show how NSX-T addresses container workloads and integrates with frameworks like Kubernetes. We'll also cover the multi-cloud networking and security capabilities that allow consistent networking policies across any cloud, public or private. Finally, we'll look at how SD-WAN has become part of the NSX portfolio, enabling networking and security to be deployed from cloud to data center to edge.  [More info](https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld18eu/eucatalog?search=NET1285BE).

## Product Preview

This year the UX team organizes design studios that allows you to provide feedback on a future product. The product you will see will blow your mind. But since it's NDA, I can't tell ;) Just show up and see for yourself! **Every day - multiple sessions available \[UX8011E\]** (Design Studio) **[Kubernetes on vSphere](https://my.vmworld.com/widget/vmware/vmworld18eu/eucatalog?search=ux8011e)** Do you want to offer Kubernetes? Explore user interface concepts for managing containerized cloud native applications using vSphere together with other products such as PKS. This session is part of the VMware Design Studio where you have the opportunity to participate in interactive sessions exploring technical previews and early design ideas. Because of the early nature of these designs, participants will be asked to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to participate. By [Boaz Gurdin](https://twitter.com/boazgurdin), User Experience Researcher, VMware [Pamel Shinh](https://twitter.com/Pamel5), Product Designer, VMware Hope to see you there. Enjoy your VMworld!
