Last Friday I had the honor to join Pete Flecha a.k.a. Pedro Arrow and John Nicholson on their always fantastic podcast Virtually Speaking. Together with [Niels](http://www.nielshagoort.com) we talked about what it takes to write a book such as the [VMware vSphere 6.5 Host Resources Deep Dive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1540873064/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1540873064&linkCode=as2&tag=frankdennem0f-20&linkId=5afdf9e22610abeca733b5bd747d04d0).
