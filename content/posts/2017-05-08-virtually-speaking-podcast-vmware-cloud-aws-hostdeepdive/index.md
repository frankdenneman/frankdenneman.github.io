Last Friday I had the honor to join Pete Fletcha a.k.a. [Pedro Arrow](https://twitter.com/vPedroArrow) and [John Nicholson](https://twitter.com/Lost_Signal) on their always fantastic podcast [Virtually Speaking](https://soundcloud.com/virtuallyspeakingpodcast). Unfortunately, John was ill that morning, but [Duncan](https://twitter.com/DuncanYB) helped us out by taking a break from his vacation. We spoke about the upcoming service VMware Cloud on AWS ([#VMWonAWS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/VMWonAWS)). Why it bring such a tremendous value for customers who are in the process of building a hybrid cloud, and how it can help organizations who are already a customer of both VMware and AWS. Closing off we touched upon the progress of the upcoming book '[vSphere 6.5 Host Resources Deep Dive](https://twitter.com/hostdeepdive)'. I had a blast being a guest again, enjoy the show! https://soundcloud.com/virtuallyspeakingpodcast/episode-43-vmware-cloud-on-aws?utm\_source=soundcloud&utm\_campaign=wtshare&utm\_medium=Twitter&utm\_content=https%3A//soundcloud.com/virtuallyspeakingpodcast/episode-43-vmware-cloud-on-aws
