Although the selection process of the submitted VMworld 2018 sessions is still ongoing, vBrownbag announced their [call for papers](https://vbrownbag.com/2018/04/vbrownbag-techtalks-at-vmworld-2018/). As Duncan mentioned in his [Call for paper article](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2018/02/19/vmworld-call-papers-opened-tips/) _'Good luck, and remember: if you don’t end up getting selected, submit the proposal to a VMUG near you instead. They are always begging for community sessions.'_ Think about signing up for the vBrownbag as well. Since last year all the vBrownbag sessions are published in the content catalog. Thus your session is visible for all 23.000+ attendees. Go right ahead and [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOg9AflEa1HoK-ADDxGAqAUu3qsaYKaNpDsxIrYLx68FvsPg/viewform).
