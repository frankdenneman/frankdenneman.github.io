We're extending the VMware Cloud Services overview series with a tech preview of the VMware Cloud Flex Compute service. [Frances Wong](https://twitter.com/frances_wong) shares a lot of interesting use cases and details with us in this episode!

In short, VMware Cloud Flex Compute is a new approach to the Enterprise-grade VMware Cloud, but instead of obtaining a full SDDC, it is sliced, diced, sold, and deployed by fractional SDDC increments in the global cloud.
