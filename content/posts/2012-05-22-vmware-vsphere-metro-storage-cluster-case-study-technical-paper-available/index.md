As of today the VMware vSphere Metro Storage Cluster Case Study Technical Paper is available at [http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/10284]( http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/10284)

> VMware vSphere Metro Storage Cluster (VMware vMSC) is a new configuration within the VMware Hardware Compatibility List. This type of configuration is commonly referred to as a stretched storage cluster or metro storage cluster. It is implemented in environments where disaster/downtime avoidance is a key requirement. This case study was developed to provide additional insight and information regarding operation of a VMware vMSC infrastructure in conjunction with VMware vSphere. This paper will explain how vSphere handles specific failure scenarios and will discuss various design considerations and operational procedures.

For me this is a new milestone as this is my first published white paper. I had the honor and pleasure of collaborating with Duncan Epping ([DuncanYB](https://twitter.com/#!/duncanyb)), Ken Werneburg ([@vmken](https://twitter.com/#!/vmken)), Stuart Hardman ([@shard\_man](https://twitter.com/#!/shard_man)) and Lee Dilworth (@[LeeDilworth](https://twitter.com/#!/leedilworth)) on this paper. Working with industry-leading experts, testing all sorts of scenario's and listing to them analyzing and brainstorming was inspiring and very educational. Not only is this content great for customers who are interested in vSphere Metro Storage Cluster solutions, but is very educational for people who are interested in HA in general. A must read!
