Recently I started to spend a lot of time in MS word again, and as a stickler for details I dislike a mishmash of font types throughout my document. I spend a lot of time on configuring the styles of the document, yet when I paste something from other documents, MS word tend to ignore these. Correcting the format burns a lot of time and it simply annoys the crap out of me. To avoid this further, I started to dig around to find some font and style related shortcut keys. Yesterday I tweeted the shortcut key to apply the normal style and by the looks of retweets many of you are facing the same challenge. Below is a short list of shortcut keys that I use. There are many more, share the common ones you like to use. As I use Mac I listed the Mac shortcut combination. Replace CTRL for CMD if you are using MS Word on a windows machine. **Select text:** Select all: CTRL+A Select sentence: CMD + click Select word: Double click Select paragraph: Triple click **Formatting:** Clear formatting: CTRL+spacebar Apply Normal Style: Shift+CMD+N Header 1: CMD+ALT+1 Header 2: CMD+ALT+2 Header 3: CMD+ALT+3 Change Case: CMD+Option+C (repeat combination to cycle through options) Indent paragraph: CTRL+Shift+M Remove indent: CMD+Shift+M Find and replace: F5
